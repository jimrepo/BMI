    <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
    <p>Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of weight adjusted for height, calculated as weight 
in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m2) \(^1\). Although BMI is often considered an indicator of body fatness, it is often criticised for over-stating or under-stating a person&#39;s health due to other factors such as age, gender, body shape, socio-economic status or domicile (city, rural) which are not considered.  </p>

<p>For example, some highly athletic professional footballers may have BMI&#39;s that would put them into an Overweight category!</p>

    <h2>BMI Adjusted for Age and Gender</h2>
    <p>The Shiny app, BMI Calculator, accepts input a person&#39;s weight, height, age and gender and calculates an adjusted BMI according to Qiu\(^2\)</p>

<p>\[ BMI = \frac {W} {H^{2.40} {\exp {(-0.039 gender + 0.011 age - 0.0001  age^2) }}}\]</p>

<p><b>Usage:</b> Enter Height in metres &amp; Weight in kilograms<br>
Select the radio button Gender (Male or Female), Age from the slider &amp; hit Submit<br></p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>BMI is a reasonable indicator of body fat for both adults and children. Because BMI 
does not measure body fat directly, it should not be used as a diagnostic tool. Instead, 
BMI should be used as a measure to track weight status in populations and as a 
screening tool to identify potential weight problems in individuals.\(^1\) <br>
Adjusting for age and gender is an approach that more closely considers a person&#39;s physical charactericts.</p>
